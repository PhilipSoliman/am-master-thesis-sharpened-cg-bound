# Interim Presentation

- Add the slides from your interim presentation (preferably in PDF format) to this directory.
- If available, also include the source files (e.g., PowerPoint or LaTeX files) for future reference or updates.
- Ensure the files are well-organized and clearly named (e.g., `interim_presentation.pdf`) for easy identification.
