- General feedback
  - Good that you start with a general introduction
  - I would suggest to try to speak more freely
  - You do you not have to Go into all the details of the derivations
  - Note that the final presentation will be 30 minutes; the presentation is a bit long
  - Nice slides. You also added all the references; very good



- Slide 5:
  - What would happen if the problem was time-dependent
- Slide 8:
  - Why an iterative solver?
  - It seems that you made a slide on FEM for the heterogeneous problem, but you did not discuss the details of the solver
  - You mentioned the sharpened bound without showing the actual bound
- Slide 14:
  - What are the assumptions to be able to apply CG
  - What would you do in practice to determine m?
- Slide 18:
  - Why does the Kyrlov method only minimize the residual polynomial on the eigenvalues of $A$?
- Slide 20:
  - Make sure that you introduce all the notation
  - If the equality only holds for the uniform distribution of the eigenvalues, what in the other cases?
- Slide 22:
  - What is the connection to preconditioners? So far you only discussed CG itself
- Slide 26:
  - How can the iteration count go above the bound?
  - I think that the precision currently is probably not higher than in the 90s
- Slide 30:
  - The reference 3 is misleading here, because it looks like a power
- Slide 31:
  - What is the resulting convergence rate?
- Slide 34:
  - Does the resulting bound not depend on $a$ and $b$ anymore?
- Slide 38:
  - What is the difference between the alternating Schwarz method and additiveSchwarzpreconditioners
- Slide 41:
  - Not all multiscale coarse spaces use eigenmodes and not all are robust
  - I think it is not necessary to Go into all the different coarse spaces
- Slide 43:
  - I think it would be good to cite the original references
- Slide 44:
  - The discussion on why the iteration count goes up is not fully correct



- Demo:
  - What about a case where the contrast is much larger?
- Research questions:
  - Make the questions a bit more specific an measurable
  - I think a bit fewer questions would be sufficient
