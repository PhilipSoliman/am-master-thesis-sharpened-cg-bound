- ML-Accelerated Solvers for CFD Simulations:
	- context:
		- nonlinear solvers using NR-like methods often take up main portion of computational work
		- pseudo time stepping methods enhanced with local NNs
		- above resulted in 'further acceleration'
	- open questions:
		- evidence-based selection of input features
		- further investigation of the locality of the NN models
		- investigation of feature importance
		- adaptation of the involved network architectures
	- milestones:
		- Reproduction of existing pseudo-timestepping framework in OpenFoam <- no FROSch?
		- Improve existing approach
		- Evaluation for carefully chosen test cases

- Parallel Multiplicative One-Level Schwarz Preconditioners with FROSch and Trilinos
	- context:
		- Schwarz methods are already used in FROSch. 
		- Currently only additive Schwarz preconditioners are in use
		- This is because these preconditioners can be computed independently from each other
	- main goal: Implement parallel multiplicative one-level Schwarz operators in FROSch 
	- sub tasks:
		- Implement FP iteration (no NR?)
		- Employ coloring techniques to parallelize construction of multiplicative Schwarz operator
		- Compare parallel scalability to state of the art in FROSch

-  Work on solver in FROSch: 
	- context:	
		- rapidly changing coefficients in PDEs (high-contrast elliptic problems)
