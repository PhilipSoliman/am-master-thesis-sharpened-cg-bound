# Progress update 4
**Date**: 26/05/2025 <br>
**Time**: 9:00-10:00
 
## Progress update
- Merged interim-XXX branches into main branch
- Processed all of Alexander's and most of Felipe's feedback on interim report
- Added clearly formatted problem, theorem (+proof) and definition color boxes
- Added Appendices on CG's derivation, Chebyshev polynomials and Rayleigh quotient for handy improved flow of report
- CG convergence section is now more detailed and more prominently features the MIN-MAX error bound
$$
    ||\mathbf{e}_m||_A < \min_{r \in \mathcal{P}_{m-1}, r(0) = 1} \max_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} |r(\lambda)| ||\mathbf{e}_0||_A.\tag{1}
$$
- Literature section:
    - Improved discussion on spectral gap in high-contrast problems
    - Corrected discussion of MsFEM
    - Made proper distinction between MsFEM and DD-methods with coarse space based on MsFEM (ACMS, AMS)
    - Added more literature and discussion on CG's superlinear convergence for non-uniform spectra
- Three methods to solve (1)
    1. Suppose all $\lambda_i$ are known, then pose $r(\lambda) = \sum c_i \lambda^i$ with $c_0 = 1$ and numerically solve a convex optimization problem for the coefficients $c_i$ to minimize (1) ⟵ <span style="color:#6fbf73">easy implementation, sharp</span>, but <span style="color:#e57373">not generalizable, requires knowledge of all eigenvalues</span>
    2. Use a clever multiplication of Chebyshev polynomials to minimize (1) directly, akin to what Axelsson did in his original paper 1976 in and improved upon in later papers, as well as what we did in multiple clusters ⟵ <span style="color:#6fbf73">fast, generalizable</span>, but <span style="color:#e57373">not guaranteed to be sharp</span>
    3. Use logarithmic potential theory to bound (1) ⟵ <span style="color:#6fbf73">sharp, generalizable, not applied to spectra with gap yet</span>, but <span style="color:#e57373">hard find Green function; see steps in literature section</span>
    4. Regression

## Questions
-  Which methods (1,2,3) to explore?

## Roadmap
- Timeline
    - June: 
        > Experiment more with method 2, testing its limits and applicability

        > Try out method 1 on some spectra, see how sharp it is (Yay or Nay?)

        > Explore method 3, investigate Green function for two cluster case (Yay or Nay?)

        > Document results
    - July
        > Green light
    - Summer:
        > ?
    - September:
        > Write final report, including all methods and results

        > Green light

        > Prepare for final presentation

        > Defense
- Might move more of the Schwarz methods section to appendices or remove them entirely
