# Kick off meeting:
- IterMethBook
	- ch 6: krylov meth
		- everything up to GMRES 
		- 6.7 CG meth
		- assume system matrix is symmetric (for now)
	- ch 9: PCG meth

- NL-IterMeth
	- ch 2: CG 
		- focus on relation of minimization problem to system matrix eigen values

- Road map:
	- understand above literature (progress tracked in [[Conjugate gradient method]])
	- make matrices with various eigen value distributions and check results on the number of iterations. See if you can find a dependence between the distribution of eigen values and the final iteration count. 
	- As a follow up construct the polynomial described in the literature and plot it in combination with the eigenvalue spectrum.  
	- report on the above (make presentation, etc...)
	- discuss progress next meeting (Note I lead the meeting, plan it, time it and I am responsible)
	- Alexander is still figuring out MaRe stuff, so wait until next meeting. 
	- review 1-2 level schwarz methods from CFD
	- look into multi-scale fem -> Alexander & Fem will send references on this
	- look into msfem as coarse space method -> Alexander & Fem will send references on this
	- check out code python prototype code by Felipe on [GitHub]([https://github.com/Filipe-Cumaru/msfem-sandbox)
	- get acquainted with frosch: follow the [demo](https://github.com/searhein/frosch-demo/tree/main)
	- scale-up results found by Felipe to bigger systems (HPC part)

- Next deadline: 19th of December
