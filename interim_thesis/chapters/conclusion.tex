This thesis stresses that the classical condition number-based CG iteration bound does not fully capture the convergence behavior in high-contrast heterogeneous elliptic problems, particularly when Schwarz preconditioners are employed. By incorporating additional spectral characteristics, such as the distribution, clustering, and gaps of eigenvalues in the eigenspectrum, the refined bound offers a more accurate and discriminative measure of iterative performance. Preliminary results indicate that these spectral properties significantly influence the convergence rate and can be exploited to predict and compare the efficacy of different preconditioners. 

Further research is required to test the refined bound on an eigenspectrum typically found in Darcy problems and to develop robust methods for estimating the full eigenspectrum in high-contrast problems found in practice. This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of iterative solvers and has practical importance for improving computational efficiency in solving complex elliptic PDEs.
