\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
In this chapter we present and discuss two experiments with the sharpened CG iteration bounds from \cref{alg:multi_cluster_cg_bound,alg:multi_tail_cluster_cg_bound} applied to the approximate eigenspectra calculated as by-product of the PCG method applied to the discretized elliptic problem \cref{prob:elliptic_problem_discretized}. The first experiment in \cref{sec:sharpness_of_bounds} tests the absolute sharpness of the new bounds as compared to the actual number of CG iterations required for convergence given a residual error tolerance $\epsilon_r$. Where the first experiment presumes a full spectrum to be available at the time of calculating the new bounds, this is usually not the case in practice. Therefore, the second experiment in \cref{sec:early_estimation_of_iterations} investigates the capability of the new bounds to predict the number of CG iterations required for convergence, but based on approximate spectra obtained in the first $N_{iter}$ iterations. Each experiment is conducted on the same set of meshes $\mathcal{Q}$, using the preconditioners from $\mathcal{M}^{-1}$ and for every coefficient function $\mathcal{C}_{\text{const}}$, $\mathcal{C}_{\text{3layer, vert}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\text{edge slabs, around vertices}}$ as described in \cref{ch:implementation}.

    \caption{Plot of the number of CG iterations $m$ required to achieve convergence of the solution to \cref{prob:elliptic_problem_discretized} in the sense of criterion \cref{eq:residual_convergence_criterion_r} with $\epsilon_r=10^{-8}$. The left and right columns correspons to the $\mathcal{C}_{\text{3layer, vert}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\text{edge slabs, around vertices}}$ coefficient functions. Also shown are the corresponding classical $m_1$, multi-cluster $m_{N_{\text{cluster}}}$, and multi-tail-cluster $m_{N_{\text{tail-cluster}}}$ bounds for the CG method applied to the eigenspectra obtained from the Lanczos matrix convergence (Ritz values).}

\section{Early estimation of CG iteration bounds}\label{sec:early_estimation_of_iterations}
\todo{Add plot of bounds convergence on some high-contrast coefficient function for a robust coarse space (AMS) together with its eigenspectrum. Explain the migration of Ritz values and the fact that we need to wait for temporary convergence of clusters to reliably calculate and update the new bounds.}
\todo{Show the convergence of the RGDSW bound. Ritz value migration happens more slowly so we need more iterations before we can update the bounds.}
\todo{Explain setup of tables}
\input{../tables/cg_iteration_bound_coef=const.tex}
\input{../tables/cg_iteration_bound_coef=3lvert.tex}
\input{../tables/cg_iteration_bound_coef=slabs_around_vertices.tex}
\todo{Discuss the tables: how many iterations are needed to get a good estimate of the bounds? How do the bounds compare to the classical bound? How do the bounds compare to each other?}
