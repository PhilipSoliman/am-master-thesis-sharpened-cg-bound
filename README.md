# Master Thesis Project

## Getting Started

Welcome to your master thesis project! This document outlines the key steps and resources to help you successfully complete your project.

## Supervision Meetings

Regular meetings with your daily supervisors are essential for staying on track. Aim for weekly or bi-weekly meetings. [Schedule a meeting with Alexander Heinlein](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/8c40d346703344f2bbeb0132b51295f1@tudelft.nl?anonymous&ep=plink). For each meeting:
- **Prepare an agenda**: Outline the topics you want to discuss.
- **Prepare slides**: Summarize your progress and key points.
- **Follow up**: Share brief meeting minutes and outline next steps.

## Timeline

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Register the project in MaRe.
- [ ] Upload the DCO to MaRe.
- [ ] Prepare and upload the project description in MaRe.

### Interim Thesis
- [ ] Conduct a literature study.
- [ ] Set up the software environment and begin preliminary implementation and experiments.
- [ ] Formulate research questions.
- [ ] Write the interim thesis and submit it for feedback.

*The interim thesis and presentation should be completed after roughly 2-3 months of starting the project.*

### Interim Presentation
- [ ] Find all committee members (at least one external to the Numerical Analysis group).
- [ ] Schedule the presentation and invite all committee members (attendance by daily supervisors is mandatory; others are optional).
- [ ] Prepare the presentation.

### Research and Finalization
- [ ] Enter your thesis committee in MaRe.
- [ ] Perform research and write the thesis.
- [ ] Schedule a green light meeting (minimum 6 weeks before the defense).
    - **Green light**: Daily supervisors agree the thesis is ready for defense, except for minor adjustments.
- [ ] Finalize the thesis.
- [ ] Send the thesis to committee members for feedback (at least 2 weeks before the defense).
- [ ] Prepare for and attend the defense.

*The total duration of the project is flexible and depends on the intensity with which the student works on the project.*

## General Tips
- **Continuously collect literature** throughout the project.
- **Write regularly** to avoid last-minute stress.
- **Review the grading rubric** to ensure alignment with evaluation criteria.

## Repository Structure

- [code](code): Contains all project-related code. It is strongly recommended that you setup different repositories for your code and add them as [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to this directory. With submodules, you can manage each repository individually (create branches, submit merge requests, etc.).
- [data](data): Contains datasets and related files.
- [defense](defense): Contains materials for the defense.
- [final_thesis](final_thesis): Contains the final thesis document.
- [interim_presentation](interim_presentation): Contains materials for the interim presentation.
- [interim_thesis](interim_thesis): Contains the interim thesis document.
- [manuscript](manuscript): Contains the work-in-progress manuscript for the thesis.
- [meetings](meetings): Contains meeting notes and related materials.
- [project_description](project_description): Contains the project description.

**Note**: Other repositories and Overleaf projects can be added to this repository using Git submodules. This allows you to manage external resources or collaborative documents within the same project structure. For more information, refer to the [Git Submodules documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
