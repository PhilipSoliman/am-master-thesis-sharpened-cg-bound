  abstract  = {Two-level overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition methods for second-order elliptic problems in two dimensions are proposed using coarse spaces constructed from the Approximate Component Mode Synthesis (ACMS) multiscale discretization approach. These coarse spaces are based on eigenvalue problems using Schur complements on subdomain edges. It is then shown that the convergence of the resulting preconditioned Krylov method can be controlled by a user-specified tolerance and thus can be made independent of heterogeneities in the coefficient of the partial differential equation. The relations of this new approach to other known adaptive coarse space approaches for overlapping Schwarz methods are also discussed. Compared to one of the competing adaptive approaches, the new coarse space can be significantly smaller. Compared to other competing approaches, the eigenvalue problems are significantly cheaper to solve, i.e., the dimension of the eigenvalue problems is minimal among the competing adaptive approaches under consideration. Our local eigenvalue problems can be solved using one iteration of LobPCG for essentially the same cost as a Cholesky-decomposition of a Schur complement on a subdomain edge.},

  abstract = {Methods are presented for automatically constructing coarse spaces of low dimension for domain decomposition algorithms. These constructions use equivalence classes of nodes on the interface between the subdomains into which the domain of a given elliptic problem has been subdivided, e.g., by a mesh partitioner such as METIS; these equivalence classes already play a central role in the design, analysis, and programming of many domain decomposition algorithms. The coarse space elements are well defined even for irregular subdomains, are continuous, and are well suited for use in two-level or multilevel preconditioners such as overlapping Schwarz algorithms. An analysis for scalar elliptic and linear elasticity problems reveals that significant reductions in the coarse space dimension can be achieved while not sacrificing the favorable condition number estimates for larger coarse spaces previously developed. These estimates depend primarily on the Lipschitz parameters of the subdomains. Numerical examples for problems in three dimensions are presented to illustrate the methods and to confirm the analysis. In some of the experiments, the coefficients have large discontinuities across the interface between the subdomains, and in some, the subdomains are generated by a mesh partitioner.}

  abstract = {A new reduced-dimension adaptive generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW) overlapping Schwarz method for linear second-order elliptic problems in three dimensions is introduced. It is robust with respect to large contrasts of the coefficients of the partial differential equations. The condition number bound of the new method is shown to be independent of the coefficient contrast and only dependent on a user-prescribed tolerance. The interface of the nonoverlapping domain decomposition is partitioned into nonoverlapping patches. The new coarse space is obtained by selecting a few eigenvectors of certain local eigenproblems which are defined on these patches. These eigenmodes are energy-minimally extended to the interior of the nonoverlapping subdomains and added to the coarse space. By using a new interface decomposition, the reduced-dimension adaptive GDSW overlapping Schwarz method usually has a smaller coarse space than existing GDSW and adaptive GDSW domain decomposition methods. A robust condition number estimate is proven for the new reduced-dimension adaptive GDSW method which is also valid for existing adaptive GDSW methods. Numerical results for the equations of isotropic linear elasticity in three dimensions confirming the theoretical findings are presented.}

An analysis of one such approximate factorization, the SSOR method, is given, and some inherently advantageous properties of the conjugate gradient acceleration method are pointed out. A comparison is made of the computational complexity and storage in the SSOR preconditioned method with some direct methods applied to second order discretized boundary value problems. For plane problems of average size the direct methods are somewhat faster if enough right hand sides are present. For large enough problems (large number of nodes) the iterative method is faster. For three-dimensional problems no Cholesky factorization method can compete with the SSOR preconditioned method, not even for average sized problems.}

Multiscale basis functions are constructed using eigenvectors of a carefully selected local spectral problem. This local spectral problem strongly depends on the choice of initial partition of unity functions. The resulting space enriches the initial multiscale space using eigenvectors of local spectral problem. The eigenvectors corresponding to small, asymptotically vanishing, eigenvalues detect important features of the solutions that are not captured by initial multiscale basis functions. Multiscale basis functions are constructed such that they span these eigenfunctions that correspond to small, asymptotically vanishing, eigenvalues. We present a convergence study that shows that the convergence rate (in energy norm) is proportional to (H/Λ∗)1/2, where Λ∗ is proportional to the minimum of the eigenvalues that the corresponding eigenvectors are not included in the coarse space. Thus, we would like to reach to a larger eigenvalue with a smaller coarse space. This is accomplished with a careful choice of initial multiscale basis functions and the setup of the eigenvalue problems. Numerical results are presented to back-up our theoretical results and to show higher accuracy of MsFEMs with spectral multiscale basis functions. We also present a hierarchical construction of the eigenvectors that provides CPU savings.}

We present a new bound on the relative error after n iterations. This bound is valid in an asymptotic sense when the size N of the system grows together with the number of iterations. The bound depends on the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution and on the ratio \$n/N\$. Under appropriate conditions we show that the bound is asymptotically sharp.Our findings are related to some recent results concerning asymptotics of discrete orthogonal polynomials. An important tool in our investigations is a constrained energy problem in logarithmic potential theory.The new asymptotic bounds for the rate of convergence are illustrated by discussing Toeplitz systems as well as a model problem stemming from the discretization of the Poisson equation.}

  abstract   = {In this paper, we study a multiscale finite element method for solving a class of elliptic problems arising from composite materials and flows in porous media, which contain many spatial scales. The method is designed to efficiently capture the large scale behavior of the solution without resolving all the small scale features. This is accomplished by constructing the multiscale finite element base functions that are adaptive to the local property of the differential operator. Our method is applicable to general multiple-scale problems without restrictive assumptions. The construction of the base functions is fully decoupled from element to element; thus, the method is perfectly parallel and is naturally adapted to massively parallel computers. For the same reason, the method has the ability to handle extremely large degrees of freedom due to highly heterogeneous media, which are intractable by conventional finite element (difference) methods. In contrast to some empirical numerical upscaling methods, the multiscale method is systematic and self- consistent, which makes it easier to analyze. We give a brief analysis of the method, with emphasis on the “resonant sampling” effect. Then, we propose an oversampling technique to remove the resonance effect. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method through extensive numerical experiments, which include problems with random coefficients and problems with continuous scales. Parallel implementation and performance of the method are also addressed.},

  abstract = {The multiscale finite-volume (MSFV) method has been derived to efficiently solve large problems with spatially varying coefficients. The fine-scale problem is subdivided into local problems that can be solved separately and are coupled by a global problem. This algorithm, in consequence, shares some characteristics with two-level domain decomposition (DD) methods. However, the MSFV algorithm is different in that it incorporates a flux reconstruction step, which delivers a fine-scale mass conservative flux field without the need for iterating. This is achieved by the use of two overlapping coarse grids. The recently introduced correction function allows for a consistent handling of source terms, which makes the MSFV method a flexible algorithm that is applicable to a wide spectrum of problems. It is demonstrated that the MSFV operator, used to compute an approximate pressure solution, can be equivalently constructed by writing the Schur complement with a tangential approximation of a single-cell overlapping grid and incorporation of appropriate coarse-scale mass-balance equations.}
