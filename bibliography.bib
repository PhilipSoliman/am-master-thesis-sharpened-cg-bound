  abstract = {Two-level overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition methods for second-order elliptic problems in two dimensions are proposed using coarse spaces constructed from the Approximate Component Mode Synthesis (ACMS) multiscale discretization approach. These coarse spaces are based on eigenvalue problems using Schur complements on subdomain edges. It is then shown that the convergence of the resulting preconditioned Krylov method can be controlled by a user-specified tolerance and thus can be made independent of heterogeneities in the coefficient of the partial differential equation. The relations of this new approach to other known adaptive coarse space approaches for overlapping Schwarz methods are also discussed. Compared to one of the competing adaptive approaches, the new coarse space can be significantly smaller. Compared to other competing approaches, the eigenvalue problems are significantly cheaper to solve, i.e., the dimension of the eigenvalue problems is minimal among the competing adaptive approaches under consideration. Our local eigenvalue problems can be solved using one iteration of LobPCG for essentially the same cost as a Cholesky-decomposition of a Schur complement on a subdomain edge.},

abstract = {We present a parametrized class of matrices for which the rate of convergence of the conjugate gradient method varies greatly with the parameter and does not appreciably depend on the algorithm implementation. A small change in the eigenvalue distribution can lead to a large change in the sensitivity of CG to rounding errors. A theorem is proved which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for ordering exact arithmetic CG processes for systems with different spectra according to the energy norm of the error. Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 continue Paige's and Greenbaum's work.}

abstract = {A general method in the form of an accelerated preconditioned iterative refinement method (including some wellknown iterative methods and direct factorization methods) is presented for the solution of symmetric, sparse matrix problems. An analysis of one such approximate factorization, the SSOR method, is given, and some inherently advantageous properties of the conjugate gradient acceleration method are pointed out. A comparison is made of the computational complexity and storage in the SSOR preconditioned method with some direct methods applied to second order discretized boundary value problems. For plane problems of average size the direct methods are somewhat faster if enough right hand sides are present. For large enough problems (large number of nodes) the iterative method is faster. For three-dimensional problems no Cholesky factorization method can compete with the SSOR preconditioned method, not even for average sized problems.}

abstract = {In this paper we study multiscale finite element methods (MsFEMs) using spectral multiscale basis functions that are designed for high-contrast problems. Multiscale basis functions are constructed using eigenvectors of a carefully selected local spectral problem. This local spectral problem strongly depends on the choice of initial partition of unity functions. The resulting space enriches the initial multiscale space using eigenvectors of local spectral problem. The eigenvectors corresponding to small, asymptotically vanishing, eigenvalues detect important features of the solutions that are not captured by initial multiscale basis functions. Multiscale basis functions are constructed such that they span these eigenfunctions that correspond to small, asymptotically vanishing, eigenvalues. We present a convergence study that shows that the convergence rate (in energy norm) is proportional to (H/Λ∗)1/2, where Λ∗ is proportional to the minimum of the eigenvalues that the corresponding eigenvectors are not included in the coarse space. Thus, we would like to reach to a larger eigenvalue with a smaller coarse space. This is accomplished with a careful choice of initial multiscale basis functions and the setup of the eigenvalue problems. Numerical results are presented to back-up our theoretical results and to show higher accuracy of MsFEMs with spectral multiscale basis functions. We also present a hierarchical construction of the eigenvectors that provides CPU savings.}

abstract = {We give a theoretical explanation for superlinear convergence behavior observed while solving large symmetric systems of equations using the conjugate gradient method or other Krylov subspace methods. We present a new bound on the relative error after n iterations. This bound is valid in an asymptotic sense when the size N of the system grows together with the number of iterations. The bound depends on the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution and on the ratio \$n/N\$. Under appropriate conditions we show that the bound is asymptotically sharp.Our findings are related to some recent results concerning asymptotics of discrete orthogonal polynomials. An important tool in our investigations is a constrained energy problem in logarithmic potential theory.The new asymptotic bounds for the rate of convergence are illustrated by discussing Toeplitz systems as well as a model problem stemming from the discretization of the Poisson equation.}
